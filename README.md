How to run project locally:

This project use `pnpm` as packages manager. To be able to use `pnpm` from CLI please use following command:

```
npm i -g pnpm
```

From this point you should be able to run project/install packages using old commands but instead of `npm` use `pnpm` like:

```
pnpm i <package name>
pnpm run dev
```
